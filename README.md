# Boundless-Shopper
Scans Boundless market data for best prices and quantities based on user input.


Descriptions:
	main.bat - Pulls all item market data from Boundlexx API

	parse.bat - Lets you choose what price margin and minimum quantities to search for then writes them to bestRoute.json

	search.bat - Allows you to see Requests or Shops for a specific item above or below a given price.

	worlds.bat - Allows you to see for specific colors or ores on any worlds.



Instructions:
	For the most update to date market prices you should run main.bat. After it has finished (will take some time), run parse.bat and set your parameters for your profit margin and your minimum quantity you'd like to search for. Once done, all of the shops meeting your criteria will be saved to bestRoute.json.

Enjoy! :) - It's not perfect but it functions. I've made plenty of money with this tool.
